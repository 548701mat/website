<p> Before you can start playing go to the Minecraft Website and donwload the game. When Minecraft is downloaded open it up and then make a world. When you load your world, you need to find a tree and break it down for the logs by holding left click(pc) or right trigger(console). Be careful cause there is fall damage. After getting logs you need to open your inventory by pressing E (pc) or X (console). Drag the logs to the crafting area of your inventory to make planks. When you planks put the planks in a 2 by 2 you make a crafting table. When you make the crafting table you can place down with left trigger (consle) or right click (pc)   </p>

<p> When you place down the crafting table right click it(pc) or left trigger(consle) to use it. After opening the cracting your going to want to make a wodden picaxe. In order to craft it your going to need 3 planks and 2 sticks to make a wooden picaxe. For you to make sticks you need 2 planks in a 1 by 2 virtically. When you do that you get 4 sticks and will be able to craft a picaxe. You must put 1 plank in each of 3 top boxes and put the sticks in the middle then the bottem middle. If you want to make better pickaxe just replace the top 3 planks with either cobblestone, iron, gold, or dimonds  </p>

<H1>Mining</H1>

<H2>The Depths</H2>

<p> When you start mining you need to know what to mine and what you can't mine. When you have a wooden picaxe you can only mine stone, coal, diorite, andesite, granite. With a stone picaxe you can mine iron, lapus, and everything that the wodden picaxe can mine. With the iron pickaxe you can mine gold, redstone, dimonds, emeralds, and everything from the stone picaxe. With a dimond picaxe cou can mine obsidian and everything from the iron picaxe.  <p>

<H1>The Furnace</H1>

<p> When you 8 cobblestone you can craft a furnce. Go to a crafting table and put the cobble stone around the middle square. Then you can grab the furnace and place it down just like the crafting table. Open it up just like the crafting tabe and then a hud opens up. The fuel for the furnace can be dried kelp blocks, all woods, wood tools, fishing rods, and bows. The ingredients that can be cooked are raw beef, raw porkchop, raw chicken, raw rabbit, raw mutton, raw cod, raw salmon, kelp, potatos, iron, and gold. After it finished cooking/smelting it will end up at the products. When you get the materials nessecary to mack better furneces they will be limited to what they can do. The smoker cooks only food but is twice as fast. The same thing goes for the blast furnace but it only smelts ores but twice as fast. </p>

<H1>Night Time</H1>

<H2>Mobs come out to play on easy, medium, hard or hardcore mode</H2>

<p> After 10 real life minutes pass by night falls onto the game changing things up. Before nothing was really doing any damage to you except when you take fall damage. When there is a low light level block avalibale mobs can spawn there. The mobs that can hurt you are skeletons, zombies, creepers,   </p>
